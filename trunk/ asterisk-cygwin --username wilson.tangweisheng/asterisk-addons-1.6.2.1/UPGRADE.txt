res_config_mysql
================
 - A greater variation of database handles has been made available, such that
   you can now configure realtime mysql to connect to multiple hosts and
   separate read queries from write queries.  Please familiarize yourself with
   the sample res_config_mysql.conf, as the new behavior is now specified there.

cdr_addon_mysql
===============
 - Module has been completely revamped, with some options in the config file no
   longer used and an additional new section called [columns].  Please read the
   sample config to familiarize yourself with these changes.
 - Module now permits arbitrary columns to be created and populated, just like
   cdr_adaptive_odbc, simply by adding the column to the table and defining the
   corresponding CDR(<var>) variable.  Aliases may be used to define
   relationships between differently-named variables and columns (such as the
   calldate column and the start CDR variable).
 - The calldate column, as defined in the sample configuration, uses the start
   time of the call, as opposed to the old behavior of using the end time.
   However, you may get the old behavior for calldate, simply by changing the
   alias to "end => calldate".
 - Standard columns may also be excluded now, simply by dropping the column
   name from the table, renaming the column, or aliasing the cdrname from a
   nonexistent variable (e.g. foo => amaflags).
 - Also, static values may be defined in the configuration file, for inserting
   specific static values into the MySQL CDR table.
