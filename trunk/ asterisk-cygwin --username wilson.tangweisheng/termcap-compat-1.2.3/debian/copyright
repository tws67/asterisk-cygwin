This is the Debian GNU/Linux termcap-compat package, 

This package was put together by Christian Hudon 
<chrish@debian.org> by combining the following packages:

 ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/GCC/termcap-2.0.8.tar.gz
  (for the libtermcap.so shared library)
 http://www.ccil.org/~esr/terminfo/termtypes.tc.gz
  (for the termcap database file, more information available 
   on http://www.ccil.org/~esr/ncurses.html)

Linux termcap is Copyright (C) Miquel van Smoorenburg 1994,1995,1996 (for

As for the ncurses termcap database... (quoting from the termcap file itself)

 # COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
 #
 # The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
 # California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
 #
 # Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
 # It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they 
 # took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
 # and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
 #
 # Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
 # serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
 # contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
 # graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
 #
 # This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
 # If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool. 
 # Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
 # There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!
