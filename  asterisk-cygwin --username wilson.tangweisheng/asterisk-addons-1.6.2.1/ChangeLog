	* formats/format_mp3.c: Fix reading samples from format_mp3 after
	  ast_seekstream/ast_tellstream. There is a bug when using
	  ast_seekstream/ast_tellstream with format_mp3 in that the file
	  read position is not reset before attempting to read samples. So
	  when we seek to determine the maximum size of the file (as in
	  res_agi's STREAM FILE) we weren't then resetting the file pointer
	  so that we could properly read samples. This patch addresses that
	  (in a similar manner to format_wav.c). (closes issue #15224)

	* formats/format_mp3.c: Fix audio problems with format_mp3. This
	  problem was introduced when the AST_FRIENDLY_OFFSET patch was
	  merged. I'm surprised that nobody noticed any trouble when
	  testing that patch, but this fixes the code that fills in the
	  buffer to start filling in after the offset portion of the
	  buffer. (closes issue #15850) Reported by: 99gixxer Patches:

	* formats/format_mp3.c: Fix memory corruption caused by format_mp3.
	  format_mp3 claimed that it provided AST_FRIENDLY_OFFSET in frames
	  returned by read(). However, it lied. This means that other parts
	  of the code that attempted to make use of the offset buffer would
	  end up corrupting the fields in the ast_filestream structure.
	  This resulted in quite a few crashes due to unexpected values for
	  fields in ast_filestream. This patch closes out quite a few bugs.
	  However, some of these bugs have been open for a while and have
	  been an area where more than one bug has been discussed. So with
	  that said, anyone that is following one of the issues closed
	  here, if you still have a problem, please open a new bug report
	  for the specific problem you are still having. If you do, please
	  ensure that the bug report is based on the newest version of
	  Asterisk, and that this patch is applied if format_mp3 is in use.
