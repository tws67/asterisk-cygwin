Release Status Types</a></h2>
<p>Release management is a essentially an agreement between the development community and the user community on what kind of updates can be expected for Asterisk releases, and what types of changes these updates will contain. Once these policies are established, the development community works very hard to adhere to them. However, the development community does reserve the right to make exceptions to these rules for special cases as the need arises.</p>
<p>Asterisk releases are in various states of maintenance. The states are defined here:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>None</b> - This release series is receiving no updates whatsoever. </li>
<li><b>Security-Only</b> - This release series is receiving updates, but only to address security issues. Security issues found and fixed in this release series will be accompanied by a published security advisory from the Asterisk project. </li>
<li><b>Full-Support</b> - This release series is receiving updates for all types of bugs. </li>
<li><b>Full-Development</b> - Changes in this part of Asterisk include bug fixes, as well as new features and architectural improvements.</li>
</ul>
