<h1><a class="anchor" id="AstHash">Hash Table support in Asterisk </a></h1><p>A hash table is a structure that allows for an exact-match search in O(1) (or close to that) time.</p>
<p>The method: given: a set of {key,<a class="el" href="structval.html">val</a>} pairs. (at a minimum). given: a hash function, which, given a key, will return an integer. Ideally, each key in the set will have its own unique associated hash value. This hash <a class="el" href="structnumber.html" title="Number structure.">number</a> will index into an array. "buckets" are what the elements of this array are called. To handle possible collisions in hash <a class="el" href="structvalues.html">values</a>, buckets can form a list.</p>
<p>The key for a value must be contained in the value, or we won't be able to find it in the <a class="el" href="structbucket.html">bucket</a> list.</p>
<p>This implementation is pretty generic, because:</p>
<p>1. The value and key are expected to be in a structure (along with other data, perhaps) and it's address is a "void *". 2. The pointer to a compare function must be passed in at the time of creation, and is stored in the hashtable. 3. The pointer to a resize function, which returns 1 if the hash table is to be grown. A default routine is provided if the pointer is NULL, and uses the java hashtable metric of a 75% load factor. 4. The pointer to a "new size" function, which returns a preferable new size for the hash table <a class="el" href="structbucket.html">bucket</a> array. By default, a function is supplied which roughly doubles the size of the array, is provided. This size should ideally be a prime <a class="el" href="structnumber.html" title="Number structure.">number</a>. 5. The hashing function pointer must also be supplied. This function must be written by the <a class="el" href="structuser.html" title="structure to hold users read from users.conf">user</a> to access the <a class="el" href="structkeys.html">keys</a> in the objects being stored. Some helper functions that use a simple "mult by prime, add
    the next char", sort of string hash, or a simple modulus of the hash table size for ints, is provided; the <a class="el" href="structuser.html" title="structure to hold users read from users.conf">user</a> can use these simple algorithms to generate a hash, or implement any other algorithms they wish. 6. Recently updated the hash routines to use Doubly-linked lists for buckets, and added a doubly-linked list that threads thru every <a class="el" href="structbucket.html">bucket</a> in the table. The list of all buckets is on the HashTab struct. The Traversal was modified to go thru this list instead of searching the <a class="el" href="structbucket.html">bucket</a> array for buckets. This also should make it safe to remove a <a class="el" href="structbucket.html">bucket</a> during the traversal. Removal and destruction routines will work faster. </p>
