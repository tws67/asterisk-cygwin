	* libpri 1.4.10.2 released.  A bug was found which was introduced
	  during the PTMP rewrite, which causes timers to not be cleared
	  before being set in certain situations.  This can cause the
	  scheduler to be completely filled, as well as improper Q.921 link
	  operation.

2009-04-18 Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* libpri 1.4.10.1 released.  Includes a fix for a regression found in
	  the last few revisions of libpri, but fixed in revision 859 of
	  branches/1.4.  The summary is as follows:

	* q921.c: There are two changes in this commit that are bug fixes for
	  various Q.921 issues found in internal testing.

	  Both were exposed/introduced by the TBR4 compliance patch for bug
	  #12861, in changing how retransmissions and in how the transmission
	  queue was maintained.  TX-RX message flow and acknowledgement was
	  severely restricted, since the patch changed the behavior so that
	  pending untransmitted frames would not actually be send until the
	  next RR was received in normal circumstances, or REJ when a reject
	  frame was received.  On busy links, this can severly limit the
	  amount of useful traffic that is sent, and can slow down message
	  transmission.

	  Until someone can point out where in Q.921 it is mandated for us to
	  wait for RR frames to start sending untransmitted messages, the
	  first change is to allow us to send untransmitted frames when we
	  receive new I frames as well, with updated N(R).

	  The other bug fixed is a situation caused by the restricted traffic
	  flow, if an outside process tries to send an I-frame asynchronous to
	  an RR frame, when the transmit window was previously closed and then
	  opened up but an RR has not been received yet.  A bug was found with
	  the integration of the old transmit code with the new reject
	  handling code which caused the new frame to be sent immediately,
	  regardless if there were any pending untransmitted I-frames in the
	  queue to be sent and causing an out of order I-frame to be sent to
	  the other side.  This bug is also fixed in this patch.
