	* dahdi-linux version 2.3.0 released.

2010-04-06 23:19 +0000 [r8473-8494]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* drivers/dahdi/voicebus/voicebus.c: voicebus: Change WARN_ON_ONCE
	  to BUG_ON. WARN_ON_ONCE is not defined in 2.6.9, and this
	  condition would be catastrophic anyway if it were to occur.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Load the VPM in startup,
	  not spanconfig

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Check and
	  dequeue/decipher the VPM commands atomically

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Make sure the interrupt
	  is stopped before freeing the vpmadt032

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Eliminate a trailing
	  whitespace.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Do not reconfigure the
	  VPMADT032 if shutting down. If we try to unload the driver soon
	  after a high latency event, it is possible to get stuck for
	  several seconds reloading the firmware. DAHDI-573.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Do not restart the timer
	  on alarm poll if shutting down.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Expose the maximum
	  latency as a module parameter

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Reprogram the VPM only
	  when neccessary. Only program the VPM in spanconfig if it either
	  is not setup, or if it fails a ping test. Also, if the channel
	  config fails (but ping would otherwise work), force a reset /
	  reconfiguration if the VPM module. DAHDI-573.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c, drivers/dahdi/voicebus/GpakCust.c:
	  wcte12xp: Try to reconfigure the VPM if we fail to configure the
	  channels. Also, fall back to any software echocan configured for
	  this channel for new calls while we're in the middle of a
	  recovery.

2010-04-04 16:14 +0000 [r8454-8468]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c, drivers/dahdi/voicebus/voicebus.c,
	  drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/wcte12xp.h,
	  drivers/dahdi/voicebus/GpakCust.c,
	  drivers/dahdi/voicebus/GpakCust.h: wcte12xp: Poll the VPM and
	  reset it if necessary. When the transmit descriptor runs out
	  completely, there (appears to be) a chance for a random command
	  to be sent that results in the VPMADT032 to no longer respond,
	  typically resulting in one way audio. This change introduces a
	  poll of the VPM. If it fails the poll, it will be bypassed
	  temporarily while the driver resets and reprograms it. Also, the
	  VPM is initially programmed in the spanconfig callback instead of
	  at driver load. This moves the potential for underruns until
	  later in the boot process. DAHDI-573.

	* drivers/dahdi/voicebus/voicebus.c: wcte12xp, wctdm24xxp: If we're
	  only one packet behind, just exit. This will make us two behind,
	  which is fine, and eliminates a busy loop in atomic context.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Use ARRAY_SIZE in a
	  couple more places

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c, drivers/dahdi/wctdm24xxp/base.c,
	  drivers/dahdi/voicebus/GpakCust.h: wcte12xp, wtdm24xxp: Make sure
	  the writes are retried. r8454 and r8460 introduced a change where
	  writes are not retried when other module/framer commands are
	  retried. This was an error and wasn't what was actually under
	  test. This commit restores the behavior in wctdm24xxp and makes
	  sure the vpm writes are retried in the wcte12xp.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c, drivers/dahdi/wctdm24xxp/base.c,
	  drivers/dahdi/voicebus/GpakCust.h: wcte12xp, wctdm24xxp: Close a
	  memory leak when processing VPM commands. Closes a memory leak
	  when processing the VPM write commands introduced in r8454.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c, drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/wcte12xp.h:
	  wcte12xp: Use our own workqueue for the timer and maint events.
	  When the latency is large and register reads can take 100s of
	  milliseconds, the alarm polling function could tie up one of the
	  global workqueue threads long enough to interfere with other
	  system operations. Most noticeably the console. DAHDI-573

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c, drivers/dahdi/wctdm24xxp/base.c,
	  drivers/dahdi/voicebus/GpakCust.h: wcte12xp: Resend both framer
	  and VPM commands when reads may have been lost. Latency
	  conditions could cause the driver to misconfigure the VPM which
	  would result in one way audio. DAHDI-572.

2010-03-29 20:43 +0000 [r8443]  Russ Meyerriecks <rmeyerreicks@digium.com>

	* drivers/dahdi/dahdi-base.c: dahdi-base: Fix a bug preventing
	  clobbering maint state Now the errror injection code prevents
	  placing the driver into a loopback state in a less forceful way.

2010-03-25 16:23 +0000 [r8431]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* drivers/dahdi/voicebus/voicebus.c,
	  drivers/dahdi/wctdm24xxp/base.c,
	  drivers/dahdi/voicebus/voicebus.h: wctdm24xxp: Add an 'hx8' mode
	  for buffer processing. The Hx8 series cards do not need any idle
	  buffers and idle_buffers complicate processing when using the
	  timing_cable. This change adds another mode of operation for the
	  voicebus layer for the Hx8 cards that operates without the idle
	  buffers.

2010-03-25 15:13 +0000 [r8421-8423]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* drivers/dahdi/wcb4xxp/base.c, drivers/dahdi/wcb4xxp/wcb4xxp.h:
	  wcb4xxp - add Swyx 4xS0 SX2 QuadBri PCI IDs (closes issue #16493)
	  Reported by: nic_bellamy Patches:
	  wcb4xxp_swyx_sx2_quadbri_pci_ids.patch uploaded by nic bellamy

	* drivers/dahdi/wcb4xxp/base.c: Some more wcb4xxp PCI IDs for
	  Junghanns cards Resolve two open issues. One of them that
	  accidentally wasn't closed. (closes issue #15446) (closes issue

2010-03-24 15:56 +0000 [r8410-8416]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Fix typo in last commit.
	  Wouldn't compile on kernels >= 2.6.20.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: t1xxp_maint is also
	  called with interrupts disabled from dahdi_ioctl So just push all
	  the maintenance mode processing off to the workqueue.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: t1xxp_maint can be
	  called from interrupt context. Since t1xxp_maint can be called
	  from interrupt context with the DAHDI_MAINT_LOOPSTOP cmd, push
	  the processing of that command to a workqueue since it may sleep
	  in the t1_getreg call. DAHDI-560.

2010-03-24 12:07 +0000 [r8405]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* README: document the header line of /proc/dahdi/NN

2010-03-23 21:56 +0000 [r8399-8400]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/base.c: wcte12xp: Fix potential race on
	  command handling. If we timeout a command, don't free it right
	  away unless we are the one who removed it from whatever list it
	  was on. Also, increase the timeout (2 seconds wasn't enough when
	  the firmware for the VPMOCT was being loaded on a system with 4K
	  stacks) and check the return value from t1_getreg in case there
	  were timeouts. DAHDI-560.

	* include/dahdi/kernel.h: dahdi: 'clamp' may already be backported.

2010-03-23 13:41 +0000 Russ Meyerriecks <rmeyerriecks@digium.com>

	* dahdi-linux version 2.2.1.1 released.

2010-03-10 17:04 +0000 Russ Meyerriecks <rmeyerriecks@digium.com>

	* dahdi-linux version 2.2.1.1-rc1 released.

	* wct4xxp: Added support for for qfalc v3.1 framer.

	* wct4xxp: Added ID tags for generation 5 firmware updates

2010-01-11 Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* dahdi-linux version 2.2.1 released.

	* drivers/dahdi/dahdi-base.c: dahdi-base: change
	  dahdi_kernel_fpu_end to kernel_fpu_end dahdi_kernel_fpu_end is
	  part of the MMX changes in trunk that was not committed into the
	  2.2 branch. This change snuck in as part of revision 6864 with
	  the master span processing changes.

2009-12-22 17:53 +0000 [r7723]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* voicebus, wcte12xp: Only define SLAB_STORE_USER when CONFIG_SLUB
	  is defined. On 2.6.22, there is was a bug in the SLUB allocator
	  that required defining SLAB_STORE_USER, however this setting is
	  only valid when CONFIG_SLUB is defined and not when using the
	  previous slab allocator. DAHDI-424. 

2009-12-11 23:22 +0000 [r7683-7684]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* dahdi-linux version 2.2.1-rc2 released.

	* dahdi-base: Do not wait for impulse when echotraining.  Waiting
	  here for the impulse on the transmit can cause the echotraining
	  logic to stick the channel into muted state. This is especially
	  apparent on systems that regularly do not service the interrupts
	  every millisecond. DAHDI-387. 

	* dahdi-base: Reduce the max allocation size in dahdi_reallocbufs.
	  Lower the maximum contiguous chunk that DAHDI asks for from
	  DAHDI_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE*2 to DAHDI_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE.  With 4K pages,
	  this can allow the kernel to try a little harder to find the
	  memory it needs since the request goes from order 4 to order 3. 

2009-11-23 19:20 +0000 [r7636]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* dahdi-linux version 2.2.1-rc1 released.

	* Even if we are debouncing the LOS declaration, we still expect
	  the LED to turn red as soon as we unplug the physical cable. This
	  impliments this on the wcte12xp just as it already does on the
	  wct4xxp.

	* voicebus: Fix race when enabling/disabling hardware echocan. This
	  closes a race condition where it was possible for the driver to
	  believe it has enabled the VPMADT032 when in fact, it really has
	  not. This fixes a regression introduced in dahdi-linux 2.2.0.

	* wcb4xxp: support for other HFC-xS cards (info, not code) This
	  commit includes skeleton for the support of other
	  HFC-[248]S-based cards. It still does not include all the
	  different cases for different cards. 
	  
	* wcb4xxp: B410P differences: Clock and NT/TE. * The B410P reads
	  the NT/TE switches the other way around from other cards. * Its
	  clock is also 1/2 of that of other cards, which causes wierd PCM
	  on an unmodified driver. 
	  
	* wcb4xxp: Fix PCM handling for various cards. HFC-8S cards behave
	  quite differently than HFC-4S cards here. 
	  
	* wcb4xxp: Fix LED handling in OpenVox cards (maybe also others)
	  This commit adds extra functions to handle LEDs in the non-B410P
	  cards. Only tested on OpenVox cards. OpenVox cards are known to
	  have slightly different LEDs so this is likely to be slightly
	  broken for others. 
	  
	* wctdm: Change proslic linefeed register setting Insure that
	  proslic linefeed register is not transitioned from Active to
	  On-Hook Transmission while the channel is off-hook. Replaced
	  magic numbers assigned to linefeed associated variables with more
	  descriptive constants. (issue #15352) Reported by: alecdavis

	* wctdm24xxp, wctdm: Detect if our hookstate has been set back to
	  the initial state. Check if our hookstate has been set back to
	  the initial state, typically the result of a chanconfig, and if
	  so, if we're an FXO port, forget our current battery state. This
	  allows the driver to determine and report again what the hook
	  state of the port is. (related to issue #14577) (closes issue
	  #15429) 
	  
	* wcfxo: Reset the DAA on module initialization. The X100p and
	  clones will sometimes work and sometimes not depending on wether
	  the DAA powers up in running state- this seems to be related to
	  the power supply. This problem is caused by the driver not
	  reseting the DAA and may be the source of a great many
	  intermittent problems with this card.  (closes issue #14232)

	* dahdi-base: Reduce the stack usage of dahdi_common_ioctl.  Split
	  the DAHDI_GETGAINS and DAHDI_SETGAINS ioctls into their own
	  functions and dynamically allocate the 'struct dahdi_gains'
	  structure to reduce the pressure on the stack. 
	  
	* Fixed issue where the clear channel flags were not being set at
	  the appropriate time causing a channel re-configure to mis-set
	  the last channel in each span 
	  
	* wctdm24xxp: Race condition in handling writes to proslic LINEFEED
	  register (64) The wctdm24xxp driver has a problem where a VMWI
	  IOCTL call followed immediately by a ONHOOKTRANSFER IOCTL call
	  will cause the ONHOOK transfer request to be dropped. This occurs
	  if the write to the proslic's LINEFEED register for the VMWI ICTL
	  call is not completed when the ONHOOK transfer request IOCTL is
	  processed. I also cleaned out some magic numbers used in setting
	  the linefeed register.  (closes issue #15875) Reported by:

	* wct4xxp: Check the alarm state if we're debouncing a red alarm.
	  This fixes a problem where if you set the alarmdebounce module
	  parameter on gen2+ cards, you never detect when you go into red
	  alarm.
	  
	* dahdi-base: dahdi_ioctl_[get|set]gains should return the res
	  value. In function dahdi_ioctl_getgains() and
	  dahdi_ioctl_setgains() return value assigned to res variable, but
	  these function always return 0 which is an error. (closes issue
	  #15916.) Patch by: ys 
	  
	* wctdm: Add missing break A break was missing that caused
	  DAHDI_ONHOOKTRANSFER ioctl call to fall into DAHDI_SETPOLARITY

	  wctdm_fix_ONHOOKTRANSFER.diff.txt uploaded by alecdavis (license
	  585) Tested by: alecdavis 
	  
	* dahdi-base: Do not allow jumps in system time to lock up the
	  system w/core_timer Since dahdi coretimer uses the number of
	  milliseconds that has actually passed to determine how many times
	  to call dahdi_receive, it is possible that if the system time
	  shifts after dahdi is started, that the system can appear to lock
	  up while the core timer attempts to catch up. This change
	  prevents soft lock ups under these conditions. This is brings the
	  dahdi_dummy changes in r6933 into dahdi-base. (related to issue
	  #15647) 
	  
	* wcte12xp, wctdm24xxp: VPMADT032 firmware update to 1.20. 
	  
	* wct4xxp: Debounce alarms by default for wct4xxp per AT&T 54016.
	  Also, the various alarm conditions can be debounced separately. 
	  
	* voicebus: Increase the NLP converged threshold to 18. Brings in
	  the change from r7065 that was on the
	  team/sruffell/dahdi-linux-vpm119 branch. 
	  
	* wcte12xp: Adding alarm debounce to single span driver (wcte12xp).
	  Debounce yellow alarm also. Change check alarm frequency to 100ms
	  for better debounce granularity. Fix lines over 80 cols from last
	  alarm debounce commit. 
	  
	* voicebus: Send 'idle' buffers when the transmit descriptor
	  underruns. Previously, when the host system fails to service the
	  interrupt in a timely fashion, the transmit descriptor ring for
	  the voicebus card would "go empty" since the interface wouldn't
	  have another descriptor to read in. The driver only knows that it
	  went empty, not how far behind it actually was. Therefore, the
	  driver could just increase the latency by a millisecond and keep
	  going waiting for another bump.  Additionally, when the transmit
	  descriptor actually goes empty, there are some cases where an in
	  process SPI transaction to one of the modules is interrupted,
	  which may result in corrupted module register writes on rare
	  occassions. This now makes it possible for the voicebus drivers
	  to coexist with some devices that periodically lock interrupts
	  for longer than 25ms. Before this patch, the latency would
	  constantly increase until either the modules received a corrupted
	  frame. This patch preconfigures all the receive descriptors to
	  send an "idle" packet that will be transmitted to the onboard
	  modules when the host doesn't service the interrupt within
	  (latency - 2)ms. There are now two kinds of underruns,
	  softunderuns where the driver can detect that these idlebuffers
	  have made it to the TX FIFO, and the normal hard underrun where
	  the part signals a transmit descriptor unavailable interrupt.
	  DAHDI-278. 
	  
	* voicebus: Add function to lock the latency. Now that increases in
	  the latency produce less undefined behavior on the SPI busses,
	  provide an interface for client drivers to inform the voicebus
	  library to not increase the latency if underruns are detected.
	  This can speed up loads of the driver since latency bumps do not
	  trigger a restart of the driver initialization. DAHDI-278. 

	* wctdm24xxp, wcte12xp: Lock latency when loading We no longer need
	  to retry board initialization if the latency would have increased
	  during the initialization. DAHDI-278 
	  
	* voicebus, wctdm24xxp, wcte12xp: Move a print out of the interrupt
	  handler. This can be handled just as well in process context and
	  printing to a serial console from the interrupt handler has the
	  potential to cause long latencies. 
	  
	* voicebus: Be just a little more graceful if we cannot grab our
	  interrupt line. 
	  
	* wcte12xp: use the dev_xxx macro for the debounce messages. We
	  want to know which device is reporting the debounce when there
	  are more than one card in the system.

	* Ensure that dahdi_scan correctly reports VPM presence. The
	  wct4xxp driver (for the dual/quad span T1/E1 cards) and the
	  wcte12xp driver (for the single span VoiceBus-based T1/E1 cards)
	  did not properly update the 'devicetype' field reported by
	  dahdi_scan when a VPM was found during the card startup process.
	  As a result, dahdi_scan did not show that a VPM was present on
	  the card, even if it was.

	  change in the linux kernel network device interface.
	  
	* wctc4xxp: Make the wctc4xxp_netdev_ops structure static.

	* dahdi_dummy: Do not allow jumps in system time to lock up the
	  system. Since dahdi_dummy uses the number of milliseconds that
	  has actually passed to determine how many times to call
	  dahdi_receive, it is possible that if the system time shifts
	  after dahdi is started, that the system can appear to lock up
	  while dahdi_dummy attempts to catch up. This change prevents soft
	  lock ups under these conditions. (closes issue #15647) Reported

	* wcte12xp: Disable vpmadt032 companding by default. This fixes a
	  regression in 2.2.0 where certain configurations will fail
	  patloop test or have repeated HDLC aborts because the VPMADT032
	  is modifying the clear channel or d channel data streams. This
	  restores the behavior to how it was in dahdi-linux 2.1.0.4.
	  (closes issue #15498) Reported by: alecdavis Tested by: alecdavis

	* tor2: allow using port4 as timing source Fix a silly regression
	  introduced when strict check on the timing parameter was added
	  (sync-1 is the array index, not sync itself. And 0 is a special
	  case). (closes issue #15408) Reported by: dferrer Patches:
	  tor2-4th_sync.patch uploaded by dferrer (license 525)
	  
	* Revert "wct4xxp, wcte11xp: Use the default configuration by
	  default at startup." This reverts the change introduced by
	  revision 6712. This change can cause problems when there is a VPM
	  module installed on the quad-span digital cards. 

	* dahdi-base: Add support for core timing. This essentially moves
	  the function of dahdi_dummy into the core of DAHDI. It ensures
	  that if DAHDI is loaded, it will always be able to provide
	  timing, regardless of whether there are board drivers loaded, or
	  if the board drivers are properly calling dahdi_receive. If there
	  is a master span loaded which is calling dahdi_receive, then the
	  behavior will be like it is normally.  This functionality is off
	  by default, uncomment CONFIG_DAHDI_CORE_TIMER in
	  include/dahdi/config_dahdi.h in order to enable it.

	  vpmadt032 interface into voicebus module. The voicebus library
	  was previously linked into both the wcte12xp and wctdm24xxp
	  drivers. It is now broken out into it's own module and the common

	  processing. The command queue for reading from the registers on
	  the framer is now stored in a linked_list instead of an array.
	  Allows for the locks to protect this structure to be held for
	  shorter periods of time and reduces the need to cycle through all
	  the elements in the array to decide if there is a command in the
	  queue to process. Remove the usecount and dead members from
	  struct t1 since the module reference count will allow us to know
	  when it's safe to free up the memory. This change also moves
	  alarm processing out of the interrupt handler and removes the
	  need for special interrupt handling of commands.

	* drivers/dahdi/dahdi_dummy.c: dahdi_dummy: Remove real-time clock
	  support. This removes support for using the real-time clock as a
	  timing source in dahdi_dummy. Instead, the normal kernel timers
	  method is now more accurate since it keeps track of how much real
	  time has passed to determine how many times to call dahdi_receive
	  and dahdi_transmit. This method was originally suggested by bmd.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: Verify checksum on the RTP IP
	  header before queueing.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: Poll the card in a kernel timer
	  when several channels are open. Polling the driver increases
	  overall system throughput when there are several transcoding
	  channels open by reducing the number of interrupts the the TC400M
	  generates.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: Optionally show total number of
	  packets dropped when channel is closed.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: Do not handle duplicate reponses.
	  It is possible for system activity to prevent the wctc4xxp driver
	  from responding the the firmware on the TC400M for a period of
	  time. If this occurs, the TC400M will resend a response to a
	  command that we sent. This duplicate reponse will then sometimes
	  confuse the driver. Normally this would manifest as an attempt to
	  connect the same channel together in a transcoding session.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: Set TX_COMPLETE atomically with
	  changes to the waiting_for_response_list. This change is to catch
	  a condition where it is possible, for whatever reason, for a
	  response to come in before the request is marked tx complete. If
	  this happened, it was possible to leak the response packet and
	  double complete the command.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: split send_trans_connect into a
	  connect / disconnect pair. Trivial change that makes the code
	  read more naturally. Also changes the order of members in the
	  channel_pvt structure. For more natural alignment. Both
	  non-functional changes.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: If the driver fails to register,
	  make sure we cleanup the command cache.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: Setup the TC400M to poll the own
	  bit on the descriptor ring. On certain systems having the
	  hardware poll the descriptor ring provides more reliable
	  operation that strobbing the transmit demand poll and receive
	  demand poll register.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: Make sure that messages sitting in
	  the outbound queue cause the timer to reschedule.

	* drivers/dahdi/wctc4xxp/base.c: Refactor channel command handling.
	  Makes commands and reponses clearer and easier to trouble shoot,
	  reduces pressure on the stack, and brings driver closer to kernel
	  coding standards.

	  no harm, because HPEC was the only module that used array-style
	  updates. When DAHDI was created, non-array-style updates were
	  removed, and the existing modules were converted to using
	  array-style updates. Unfortunately the new code was written based
	  on the argument names, which were incorrect. This caused all the

	  know that at the time), and it was corrected by reversing the
	  order of the arguments passed when the array-style update
	  function was called (leading to a confusing mismatch). This fixed
	  all the non-HPEC modules, but left HPEC broken, which was just

	  number of motherboards could hang from an Astribank firmware
	  newer than 1.2.20.1 / 1.4.5.1 . This was due to an some incorrect

	* drivers/dahdi/wcte12xp/vpmadt032.c,
	  drivers/dahdi/wctdm24xxp/GpakCust.c: Check the return value of
	  the down_interruptible call in order to quiet a warning. This
	  semaphore does not protect any host data structures, but only
	  accesses to the VPMADT032 module. The worse thing that could
	  happen is that the internal state of the VPM module is corrupted,
	  and then would only happen on module loading because otherwise
	  access because that is the only time this function is called in
	  the context of a user process. In this case, the module would
	  need to be reloaded again anyway. (Closes issue #13742) Reported
	  by smurfix

	* drivers/dahdi/wcb4xxp/base.c: Remove the loopback module
	  parameter since it's not implemented yet.

	* drivers/dahdi/wcb4xxp/base.c: wcb4xxp: Claim to provide DACS for
	  dahdi_scan dahdi_scan can tell that a span is digital if its
	  first channel has DACS signalling capability. While this is
	  probably not supported by the current driver, it is also
	  harmless. Without this, dahdi_scan shows the spans of this card

	* drivers/dahdi/dahdi-base.c: Use correct length for the, well,
	  dahdi transcoder device name.

	* drivers/dahdi/dahdi-base.c: Use ! to hint udev about directory
	  separator. Udev knows how to convert a '!' in the device name to
	  a directory separator. Thus the name 'dahdi!ctl' will create the
	  device /dev/dahdi/ctl . We still keep older udev rules in this
	  release for compatibility, but eventually we'll only need them to
	  set permissions.
